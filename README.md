# ðŸŒ¸**IRIS CLASSIFICATION APP**

The Iris Classification App is a machine learning project designed to classify iris flowers into their respective species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” based on four key measurements:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a classification model that can accurately identify the species of iris flowers using their physical characteristics.
